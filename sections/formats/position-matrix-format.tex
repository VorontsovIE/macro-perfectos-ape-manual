\subsubsection{Position matrix format description}
All tools described below use the following matrix file format (each binding site position 
corresponds to a separate line):

\texttt{\begin{tabular}{llll}
some\_header\\
pos1\_A\_weight & pos1\_C\_weight & pos1\_G\_weight & pos1\_T\_weight\\
\ldots\\
posw\_A\_weight & posw\_C\_weight & posw\_G\_weight & posw\_T\_weight
\end{tabular}
}

Position matrix format is appliable for all kinds of positional matrices: positional weight(PWM), count(PCM) and probability/frequency(PPM). Matrix elements meaning changes accordingly.

The number of the lines corresponds to the PWM width. If given, header will be treated as a motif name, otherwise filename will stand for motif name. Header has optional \texttt{"\textgreater"} sign at line start. Some real-life examples are provided with the package.
