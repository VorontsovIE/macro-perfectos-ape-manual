\subsubsection{Dinucleotide background options}
Dinucleotide background for dinucleotide tools has the same variants: wordwise, uniform, GC-content and full list of dinucleotide frequencies. Wordwise, uniform and GC-content backgrounds are effectively the same as mononucleotide ones and don't carry any nucleotide interdependencies.

Dinucleotide frequencies require additional clarification. Dinucleotide frequencies should be given in an alphabetical order: AA, AC, AG, \dots, TT~--- 16 terms.

Each value corresponds to a probability of a specific dinucleotide. These probabilities are \textbf{not} conditional probabilities used by an algorithm internally, but actual dinucleotide frequencies.
Please be careful if you already got used to use Markov model background.

Again, list of probabilities is comma-separated, no spaces allowed, sum of probabilities should be equal to 1.0.

Also one can specify mononucleotide ACGT-frequencies background for dinucleotide tools. It will be recognized automatically when 4 values are specified instead of 16.
