\subsection{Obtaining dinucleotide motifs from mononucleotide ones}
Dinucleotide tools take dinucleotide motifs as input parameters. But there is an option \cmdoption{--from-mono} to use basic mononucleotide motifs instead so that PWM~$\rightarrow$~DiPWM will be done internally. It can help in following cases:
\begin{itemize}
\item Comparison of dinucleotide motif versus mononucleotide one. In this case one motif should be loaded as dinucleotide motif, the rest - as mononucleotide motif internally converted to a dinucleotide motif. Further comparison performs on two dinucleotide motifs.
\item Study of mononucleotide motif properties on dinucleotide background. It isn't possible to specify dinucleotide background for a mononucleotide tool, but is possible to specify mononucleotide motif and dinucleotide background for a dinucleotide tool. 
\end{itemize}

PWM~$\rightarrow$~DiPWM is done in such a way that each word has the same score on DiPWM as it had on PWM.

{\small\textbf{Notice:} scores of words on discreted PWM and corresponding diPWM can be slightly different due to a discretization step performed after PWM~$\rightarrow$~DiPWM conversion. This discrepancy shouldn't worry you, it's small enough and goes to zero with discretization increase.}
