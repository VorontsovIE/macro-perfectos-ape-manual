\subsubsection{Dinucleotide motifs format}
Dinucleotide version of tools work with dinucleotide motifs. Dinucleotide positional matrices have similar format but contain 16 columns instead of 4. Columns go in order: AA, AC, AG, AT, CA, CC, \dots, TT.

It is also possible to use mononucleotide PWMs instead of dinucleotide PWMs. Conversion PWM~$\rightarrow$~DiPWM will be done internally in such a way that each word has the same score on DiPWM as it had on PWM. It's done with \cmdoption{--from-mono} option. 

\cmdoption{--first-from-mono} and family (analogous to options described in \ref{TransposeOption} section) are also available.

Obtaining dinucleotide motifs from mononucleotide can help you to compare mononucleotide PWM with dinucleotide PWM. Another reason to use them - is a study of mononucleotide motif properties on dinucleotide background.

{\small\textbf{Notice:} scores of words on discreted PWM and corresponding diPWM can be slightly different due to a discretization step performed after PWM~$\rightarrow$~DiPWM conversion. This discrepancy shouldn't worry you, it's small enough and goes to zero with discretization increase.}
