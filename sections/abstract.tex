\section{Abstract}
Here we present MACRO-PERFECTOS-APE software designed for practical analysis involving classic mononucleotide and dinucleotide position weight matrices (PWMs) of DNA sequence patterns often called \textit{motifs}. The common usage case for DNA motifs is representation of transcription factor binding sites.

The software allows (1) comparing different PWMs using Jaccard similarity inspired measure, e.g. scanning a motif collection for motifs similar to a given query, (2) analysing single-nucleotide variants for possible regulatory effect through transcription factor affinity changes, (3) performing basic PWM analysis (P-value and threshold estimation).
