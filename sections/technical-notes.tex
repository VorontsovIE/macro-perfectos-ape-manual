MACRO- and PERFECTOS-APE require Java Runtime Environment 1.6 (or newer) to run.
Thus *-APE should be able to function under most modern operating systems.

Several existing motif collections such as HOCOMOCO as well as several individual PWM examples are available to be used with the *-APE package:
HOCOMOCO \urldecorated{http://autosome.ru/HOCOMOCO/} TFBS model collection and several examples of PWMs (motifs) can be downloaded with MACRO-PERFECTOS-APE at \urldecorated{http://opera.autosome.ru/downloads/all_collections_pack.tar.gz}.

Windows users can get the latest Java directly from Oracle: \urldecorated{http://www.java.com}.
Modern Linux distributions typically have OpenJDK preinstalled, otherwise it should be available via a distribution-specific package manager.

The latest MACRO-PERFECTOS-APE package can be found at \urldecorated{http://opera.autosome.ru/downloads/ape.jar}. Source codes are distributed under WTFPL public license. They are available in a github repository: \urldecorated{https://github.com/prijutme4ty/macro-perfectos-ape} and as a single archive at \urldecorated{http://opera.autosome.ru/downloads/macro-perfectos-ape_src.jar}.

Web version (only basic functionality available) can be found at \urldecorated{http://opera.autosome.ru}.

This manual is also hosted on github in a repository: \urldecorated{https://github.com/prijutme4ty/macro-perfectos-ape-manual}.
