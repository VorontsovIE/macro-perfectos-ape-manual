Many additional options are available for *-APE tools. The options should be provided after the required arguments. There are common options among all *-APE tools as well as tool-specific options (already described in the respective sections).

This section covers common options: those altering input data format and those affecting calculation parameters.
The first class of options allows using input motifs as different matrices (counts, PCM or probabilities, PPM) instead of default weights (PWM), load matrices in transposed format and use mononucleotide motifs in dinucleotide tools.
The second class of options allows to set the background model, select \pvalue\ evaluation mode, limit memory consumption and so on.

For a full list of options for a particular tool please run the tool with the \cmdoption{--help} command line option.
