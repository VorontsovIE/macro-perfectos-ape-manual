Variations in genome sequences are quite common. One widespread type of variations is represented by single nucleotide substitutions called single nucleotide variants~(SNVs) or, for a given population, single nucleotide polymorphisms~(SNPs).

SNVs in gene regulatory regions may affect gene expression through alterations in transcription factor binding sites.

PWM of transcription factor binding sites provides a score for any putative TFBS.
This score roughly represents binding affinity, thus allowing to estimate 
the impact of a given substitution through change in a score value.

As discussed earlier (section~\ref{ape-introduction}) scores are not directly comparable and do not have a unified scale. More convenient measure is the \pvalue\ - the probability to find a high-scoring word at random.

PERFECTOS-APE computes motif \pvalues\ for each sequence variant and calculates \pvalue\ fold change of a given substitution. Detailed algorithm for evaluating a fold change for a given TF and a substituion:

\begin{itemize}
\item Calculate PWM scores for putative TFBS overlapping a sequence variant.
\item Choose the best position and score for both sequence variants independently.
\item Estimate \pvalues\ for the best scores.
\item Compute fold change as the rate of \pvalues.
\end{itemize}

PERFECTOS-APE tests given SNVs against a whole collection of PWMs and yields (SNV, TF) pairs of SNVs that may significantly affect TF affinity.
