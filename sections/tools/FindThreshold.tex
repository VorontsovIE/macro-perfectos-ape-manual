\subsection{FindThreshold}
This is a stand-alone tool to search for a score threshold corresponding to a given \pvalue\ for a given PWM.
\cmdname{FindThreshold} requires a PWM and a \pvalue\ as input and returns a threshold for which the set of
words scoring with this PWM no less than the given threshold has the aggregated probability equal to
the given \pvalue. The program can process a set of \pvalues, and return a set of thresholds.
This tool implements a simplified algorithm derived from that implemented in the TFM-Pvalue software of
Helen Touzet \urldecorated{http://bioinfo.lifl.fr/TFM/TFMpvalue/} but with the fixed predefined discretization level (see "PWM
discretization" section below).

\exampleof{motif file \texttt{KLF4\_f2.pat}, \pvalue\ of 0.001 and 0.0005}

NOTE! By default \cmdname{FindThreshold} looks for threshold large enough to obtain \pvalue\ not 
greater than requested (lower boundary for \pvalue). For details see \cmdoption{--boundary} option description.
