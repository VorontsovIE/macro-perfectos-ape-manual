\subsubsection{ScanCollection}
This tool uses a collection of motifs to find PWMs similar to a given query. 
The list of similar PWMs is sorted by similarity in descending order so the PWMs similar to the query are 
located at the top of the list.

NOTE! The shift and orientation are reported for PWMs from the collection relative to the query 
PWM.

\example{(search for motifs similar to \texttt{KLF4\_f2}, HOCOMOCO collection)}
\ScanCollection{motifs/KLF4\_f2.pat\\ ./hocomoco/}
% \outputheader[Output (STDOUT)]
% \cmdoutputfromfile{ScanCollectionOutput(KLF4,default).txt}

The two-pass search mode is available to recheck the top part of the list using a more precise discretization level. Second pass is executed only 
if \cmdoption{--precise [min\_similarity=0.01]}
key is specified. The precise search will recheck only the PWMs 
similar to the query with a similarity no less than \cmdoption{min\_similarity}. The results of the second pass 
will be marked by asterisk(*).

One can specify similarity cutoff with option \cmdoption{--similarity-cutoff \requiredarg{similarity cutoff}} or \cmdoption{-c \requiredarg{similarity cutoff}} to discard 
comparison results with the resulting similarity less than a given value (the 1st pass results are used). 
By default, records with similarity less than 0.05 are not shown.
In order to print comparison results for all PWMs in collection \cmdoption{--all} option can be used.

\example{(search PWMs similar to \texttt{KLF4\_f2}, extended precision for the most similar PWMs)}
\ScanCollection{motifs/KLF4\_f2.pat\\ ./jaspar/\\ --precise}
% \outputheader[Output (STDOUT)]
% \cmdoutputfromfile{ScanCollectionOutput(KLF4,precise).txt}

To find similar PWMs using a particular \pvalue\ level one should use the \cmdoption{"--pvalue"}~option. Default \pvalue\ is 0.0005.

\ScanCollection{motifs/KLF4\_f2.pat\\ ./selex/\\ --pvalue 0.001\\ --similarity-cutoff 0.06 --precise 0.1}
% \outputheader[Output (STDOUT)]
